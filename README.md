# TinyMenuGTA
PlayStation 3 Executable for Grand Theft Auto V

This is the visual studio project for Tiny Menu SPRX

Tiny Menu SPRX for GTA V on the PS3 was started by me in the winter of 2016, originally a private project just for fun. It was first released as TinyMenu in 2017.The project was a great experience for me to really grip both programming and marketing. TinyMenu ran for 6 years before officially shutting down after GTA Online, January 13, 2022.

I learned so much from the experience and knowledge and friends I gained developing TinyMenu, I want to thank everyone involved along the way.

# Disclaimer
A lot of the code in this is very very unorganized, this was a huge learning curve for me at the time. I had lots of help from friends (listed below). 
I also do not take responsibility for what anybody else does with this code. This is all written for GTA V Online PS3 edition which is not available anymore. If any of this stuff causes havoc at the hands of other dev's then that's not my fault because in it's current state as posted here, it does nothing.
